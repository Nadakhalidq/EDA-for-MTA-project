# Distribution of blood donation trucks for EDA-project

The idea of the project is to take advantage of the crowded train stations to solve the global problem, which is the need for blood donors to help many patients, so I studied the metro dataset to find the best times and days to distribute trucks to the busiest stations by ignoring the times people go to work and taking advantage of the return periods from work and night
